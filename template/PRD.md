# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

> **Instructions:**  
> This template is AI-optimized and must be filled out with both human and AI assistant clarity in mind.  
> Reference all relevant framework documents (see checklist below) and use Mermaid diagrams for all flows.  
> For each requirement, specify related guideline docs and assign clear ownership.
